### 👋 Hi, I’m @VladUsatii, a C/o 27' college student at RIT in the US.

Right now, I'm:

- Doing Web3 + Bitcoin Core security research @ RIT GCI ESL.
- Running [usatii.com](https://www.usatii.com), North America's largest content agency by views and video production. Former clients: Gamma, Airbo, 100+.
- the former technical co-founder of Onlock Learning's online platform. Having amassed attention from the likes of Elon Musk, a16z, and various market research firms I've consulted to, I have since left to build my own iteration of the platform.
- I run my own solo quant firm, managing 1 BTC currently. Yielding a consistent 106% return YoY @ $20K=1.001BTC IPP.
